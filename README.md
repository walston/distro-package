# Description

Package.shipit allows you to do 2 things:
- move your package.json into a sub-directory ready for publishing (see [`np`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/np)) without having to maintain a secondary version.
- toss tons of stuff into your version-controlled package.json (prettier, es-lint, babel, etc config) while providing a much cleaner package.json to ship npm.
